t# M.Tech Project – Statistical Modelling & Python

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for my M.Tech project on **Statistical Modelling** and **Python**. The project was supervised by **Prof. Atul Narang** (DBEB, IIT Delhi). The primary goal was to develop a statistical framework for **bioreactor data validation** using **elemental balance equations**, **regression analysis**, and **error propagation methods**. This work was awarded the **IIT Delhi BOSS Award** for **Best M.Tech Project** in 2022.

## Key Concepts
- **Statistical Algorithms**: Development of methods for identifying **gross measurement errors** in bioreactor systems using statistical hypothesis testing.
- **Python Programming**: Implementation of **least squares estimation** and **chi-square hypothesis testing** using Python.
- **Process Control**: Application of statistical methods to improve **data reliability** and **automate process control** in bioreactors.

## Features
- Python-based routines for **least squares estimation** and **error detection**.
- **Data validation framework** to identify inconsistencies and errors in over-determined systems.
- Use of **statistical models** (like **chi-square tests**) for system error identification.
- Provides a **framework for bioreactor process automation** using real-world datasets.
